Learn to C Exercises

This is a repository of all exercises I have completed thus far from the Deitel and Deitel textbook "C How to Program," Ninth Edition. 

As a new programmer, I have done my utmost to improve code, readability, clarity, flow, and optimization as I continue along my learning journey. I will make adjustments to the Read Me as necessary as I progress through the 
training material.
