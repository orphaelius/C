Learn to C Exercises

This is a repository of all exercises I have completed thus far from the Deitel and Deitel textbook "C How to Program," Ninth Edition. 

As a new programmer, I have done my utmost to improve code, readability, clarity, flow, and optimization as I continue along my learning journey. While the earlier exercises are perhaps slapdash to an external observer, I do my best to learn from my abrasive techniques early on and improve my structure and syntax with each new chapter, as I have already gained a new wealth of knowledge by Chapter 3. I will make adjustments to the Read Me as necessary as I progress through the training material!
